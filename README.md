# Godot Projects

> For learning [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and game dev in general

I'm in the process of working my way through the [Humble Bundle Godot Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/software/everything-you-need-to-know-about-godot-4-encore-software). It's always been my dream to become a game developer, and while I've dabbled with various engines and things in the past, I've never stuck to it. I'm creating this repo and working together through the courses with a friend so that I can be disciplined and do something. My short-term goals with this is just to get some reps in making things with the engine and gaining familiarity. My medium-term goal is to re-create a level from one of my favorite games. My long-term goal is to get a job in the industry.

I'll do my best to blog my progress over on [my website](https://cjcoffey.com).

Thanks for stopping by and reading. ðŸ˜Š
